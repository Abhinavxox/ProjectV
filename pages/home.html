        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p align="justify">
          The aim of the project is to minimize the queue at the energy meter
          billing counters and to restrict the usage of energy meters
          automatically, if the bill is not paid. The energy meter will provide
          the pulse as long as they have units remaining. With a certain amount
          fixed per unit, the user can prepay for the number of units they
          require. The GSM technology is used so that the consumer would receive
          messages about the consumption of power and if it reaches the minimum
          amount, it would automatically alert the consumer to recharge.

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p align="justify">
          In the present context, electricity has been as important as food to
          us. Every object or appliance that we use in our daily life is
          directly operated by electricity. Most of us use electricity
          unnecessarily as well because we are not monitoring the usage and
          calculating it properly. When consumers will use the IoT based prepaid
          energy meter that will monitor their usage and they will be able to
          see how many units are used and how many units remain unused. As it is
          a prepaid system, the customers will know how many units can be used.
          When the number of unit decreases and is about to end, a warning
          message is sent to the user via GSM module. In the case of
          non-payment, the supplier can cut off the supply at any time. It is
          based on the prepaying system and provides the bill after every
          complete use to the user. <br />
          <br />In the modern era, particularly within the industrial landscape,
          a persistent challenge has emerged wherein industries often delay
          their electricity bill payments, even in the presence of established
          penalty mechanisms. This issue underscores the necessity for a novel
          approach that can ensure timely payments. In response to this need,
          the implementation of a prepaid energy metering system becomes
          imperative. As a feasible resolution, the integration of an Internet
          of Things (IoT) based system interconnected to the internet offers a
          pragmatic solution. This not only facilitates centralized billing but
          also enhances user convenience by providing real-time insights into
          energy utilization patterns. Drawing inspiration from these concerns
          and potential solutions, the present project, titled “Smart Pre-paid
          Based Energy Meter System,” explores the utilization of Arduino
          technology to develop an innovative framework addressing these
          challenges and culminating in a more efficient energy management
          paradigm.
